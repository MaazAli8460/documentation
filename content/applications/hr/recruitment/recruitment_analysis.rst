Recruitment analysis
====================

Reporting is a helpful tool for a recruitment department so they can see which job positions have
the most applicants, or which job positions are more difficult to fill.

Knowing how many applicants each specific job position has, along with the numbers for those hired
and refused, can provide valuable insights. This information can assist the recruiting team to pivot
their strategies, to acquire the most desirable candidates.

Recruitment analysis report
===========================

Start by navigating to :menuselection:`Recruitment app --> Reporting --> Recruitment Analysis`.
This presents a line chart of all applicants for the last year.

Three separate color-coded metrics are presented: :guilabel:`In Progress`, :guilabel:`Hired`, and
:guilabel:`Refused`.

Hover the cursor over a month of the chart and a pop-up window appears, and displays the specific
numbers for that month.
